/////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Variable Declaration vs Initialization ////
///////////////////////////////////////////////
// A variable declaration introduces a new identifier.

// var declaration
// Above we create a new identifier called declaration. In JavaScript, variables are initialized with the value of undefined when they are created. What that means is if we try to log the declaration variable, we‚Äôll get undefined.

// var declaration

// console.log(declaration) // undefined
// So if we log the declaration variable, we get undefined.

// In contrast to variable declaration, variable initialization is when you first assign a value to a variable.

// var declaration

// console.log(declaration) // undefined

// declaration = 'This is an initialization'
// So here we‚Äôre initializing the declaration variable by assigning it to a string.

// This leads us to our second concept, Scope.

// Scope
// Scope defines where variables and functions are accessible inside of your program. In JavaScript, there are two kinds of scope - global scope, and function scope. According to the official spec,

// ‚ÄúIf the variable statement occurs inside a FunctionDeclaration, the variables are defined with function-local scope in that function.‚Äù.

// What that means is if you create a variable with var, that variable is ‚Äúscoped‚Äù to the function it was created in and is only accessible inside of that function or, any nested functions.

// function getDate () {
//   var date = new Date()

//   return date
// }

// getDate()
// console.log(date) // ‚ùå Reference Error
// Above we try to access a variable outside of the function it was declared. Because date is ‚Äúscoped‚Äù to the getData function, it‚Äôs only accessible inside of getDate itself or any nested functions inside of getDate (as seen below).

// function getDate () {
//   var date = new Date()

//   function formatDate () {
//     return date.toDateString().slice(4) // ‚úÖ
//   }

//   return formatDate()
// }

// getDate()
// console.log(date) // ‚ùå Reference Error
// Now let‚Äôs look at a more advanced example. Say we had an array of prices and we needed a function that took in that array as well as a discount and returned us a new array of discounted prices. The end goal might look something like this.

// discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) // [50, 100, 150]
// And the implementation might look something like this

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   return discounted
// }
// Seems simple enough but what does this have to do with block scope? Take a look at that for loop. Are the variables declared inside of it accessible outside of it? Turns out, they are.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// If JavaScript is the only programming language you know, you may not think anything of this. However, if you‚Äôre coming to JavaScript from another programming language, specifically a programming language that is blocked scope, you‚Äôre probably a little bit concerned about what‚Äôs going on here. It‚Äôs not really broken, it‚Äôs just kind of weird. There‚Äôs not really a reason to still have access to i, discountedPrice, and finalPrice outside of the for loop. It doesn‚Äôt really do us any good and it may even cause us harm in some cases. However, since variables declared with var are function scoped, you do.

// Now that we‚Äôve discussed variable declarations, initializations, and scope, the last thing we need to flush out before we dive into let and const is hoisting.

// Hoisting
// Remember earlier we said that ‚ÄúIn JavaScript, variables are initialized with the value of undefined when they are created.‚Äù. Turns out, that‚Äôs all that ‚ÄúHoisting‚Äù is. The JavaScript interpreter will assign variable declarations a default value of undefined during what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúCreation‚Äù phase.

// For a much more in depth guide on the Creation Phase, Hoisting, and Scopes see ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Guide to Hoisting, Scopes, and Closures in JavaScript‚Äù

// Let‚Äôs take a look at the previous example and see how hoisting affects it.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = undefined
//   var i = undefined
//   var discountedPrice = undefined
//   var finalPrice = undefined

//   discounted = []
//   for (i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// Notice all the variable declarations were assigned a default value of undefined. That‚Äôs why if you try access one of those variables before it was actually declared, you‚Äôll just get undefined.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   console.log(discounted) // undefined

//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// Now that you know everything there is to know about var, let‚Äôs finally talk about the whole point of why you‚Äôre here, what‚Äôs the difference between var, let, and const?

// var VS let VS const
// First, let‚Äôs compare var and let. The main difference between var and let is that instead of being function scoped, let is block scoped. What that means is that a variable created with the let keyword is available inside the ‚Äúblock‚Äù that it was created in as well as any nested blocks. When I say ‚Äúblock‚Äù, I mean anything surrounded by a curly brace {} like in a for loop or an if statement.

// So let‚Äôs look back to our discountPrices function one last time.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// Remember that we were able to log i, discountedPrice, and finalPrice outside of the for loop since they were declared with var and var is function scoped. But now, what happens if we change those var declarations to use let and try to run it?

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   let discounted = []

//   for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i)
//   console.log(discountedPrice)
//   console.log(finalPrice)

//   return discounted
// }

// discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) // ‚ùå ReferenceError: i is not defined
// üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We get ReferenceError: i is not defined. What this tells us is that variables declared with let are block scoped, not function scoped. So trying to access i (or discountedPrice or finalPrice) outside of the ‚Äúblock‚Äù they were declared in is going to give us a reference error as we just barely saw.

// var VS let

// var: function scoped

// let: block scoped
// The next difference has to do with Hoisting. Earlier we said that the definition of hoisting was ‚ÄúThe JavaScript interpreter will assign variable declarations a default value of undefined during what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄòCreation‚Äô phase.‚Äù We even saw this in action by logging a variable before it was declared (you get undefined)

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   console.log(discounted) // undefined

//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// I can‚Äôt think of any use case where you‚Äôd actually want to access a variable before it was declared. It seems like throwing a ReferenceError would be a better default than returning undefined. In fact, this is exactly what let does. If you try to access a variable declared with let before it‚Äôs declared, instead of getting undefined (like with those variables declared with var), you‚Äôll get a ReferenceError.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   console.log(discounted) // ‚ùå ReferenceError

//   let discounted = []

//   for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// var VS let

// var:
//   function scoped
//   undefined when accessing a variable before it's declared

// let:
//   block scoped
//   ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared
// let VS const
// Now that you understand the difference between var and let, what about const? Turns out, const is almost exactly the same as let. However, the only difference is that once you‚Äôve assigned a value to a variable using const, you can‚Äôt reassign it to a new value.

// let name = 'Tyler'
// const handle = 'tylermcginnis'

// name = 'Tyler McGinnis' // ‚úÖ
// handle = '@tylermcginnis' // ‚ùå TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
// The take away above is that variables declared with let can be re-assigned, but variables declared with const can‚Äôt be.

// Cool, so anytime you want a variable to be immutable, you can declare it with const. Well, not quite. Just because a variable is declared with const doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs immutable, all it means is the value can‚Äôt be re-assigned. Here‚Äôs a good example.

// const person = {
//   name: 'Kim Kardashian'
// }

// person.name = 'Kim Kardashian West' // ‚úÖ

// person = {} // ‚ùå Assignment to constant variable.
// Notice that changing a property on an object isn‚Äôt reassigning it, so even though an object is declared with const, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt mutate any of its properties. It only means you can‚Äôt reassign it to a new value.

// Now the most important question we haven‚Äôt answered yet, should you use var, let, or const? The most popular opinion, and the opinion that I subscribe to, is that you should always use const unless you know the variable is going to change. The reason for this is by using const, you‚Äôre signalling to your future self as well as any other future developers that have to read your code that this variable shouldn‚Äôt change. If it will need to change (like in a for loop), you should use let.

// So between variables that change and variables that don‚Äôt change, there‚Äôs not much left. That means you shouldn‚Äôt ever have to use var again.

// Now the unpopular opinion, though it still has some validity to it, is that you should never use const because even though you‚Äôre trying to signal that the variable is immutable, as we saw above, that‚Äôs not entirely the case. Developers who subscribe to this opinion always use let unless they have variables that are actually constants like _LOCATION_ = ....

// So to recap, var is function scoped and if you try to use a variable declared with var before the actual declaration, you‚Äôll just get undefined. const and let are blocked scoped and if you try to use variable declared with let or const before the declaration you‚Äôll get a ReferenceError. Finally the difference between let and const is that once you‚Äôve assigned a value to const, you can‚Äôt reassign it, but with let, you can.

// var VS let VS const

// var:
//   function scoped
//   undefined when accessing a variable before it's declared

// let:
//   block scoped
//   ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared

// const:
//   block scoped
//   ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared
//   can't be reassigned

}

function ObjectandArrayDestructuring(){
//     In this post, we‚Äôll cover an ES2015 feature called destructuring. To better understand it, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the basics of Javascript objects. To add a single property to an object, you use dot notation. With dot notation, you can only add properties to an object one at a time. The same syntax can be used to extract data, again, one property at a time.

// const user = {};
// user.name = 'Tyler McGinnis';
// user.handle = '@tylermcginnis';
// user.location = 'Eden, Utah';

// const name = user.name;
// const handle = user.handle;
// If you wanted to add multiple properties to an object at the same time, you would need to use JavaScript‚Äôs ‚Äúobject literal notation‚Äù when you initialize the object.

// const user = {
//   name: 'Tyler McGinnis';
//   handle: '@tylermcginnis';
//   location: 'Eden, Utah';
// };

// const name = user.name;
// const handle = user.handle;
// There‚Äôs a way to add properties one at a time, extract properties one at a time, add multiple properties at the same time, but unfortunately, there‚Äôs no comparable way to extract multiple properties from an object at the same time. That is, until ‚Äúdestructuring‚Äù was introduced in ES2015. Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties from an object. This can drastically decrease the amount of code we need to write when we want to extract data from an object, because what used to look like this,

// const name = user.name;
// const handle = user.handle;
// const location = user.location;
// can now look like this,

// const { name, handle, location } = user;
// The syntax can be a little bit weird but know that these two blocks of code are identical in that they both create and initialize three new variables. You can think of it like this, if you want to add properties to an object, do it as you are used to, on the right-hand side of the equal sign. If you want to extract properties from an object, do it on the left-hand side of the equal sign.

// Destructuring also allows you to destructure the results of function invocations. For example, below we have a function called getUser() which returns the user object. Rather than invoking getUser() and grabbing all of the properties off of it one by one, we could get the same result by destructuring the result of that invocation.

// function getUser () {
//   return {
//     name: 'Tyler McGinnis',
//     handle: '@tylermcginnis',
//     location: 'Eden, Utah'
//   };
// }

// const { name, handle, location } = getUser();
// Up until this point we‚Äôve talked about how destructuring helps us extract data from objects, but what about arrays? Though not as common as object destructuring, array destructuring is a thing and it is still pretty useful in certain circumstances, specifically when the location of an item in the array is the main differentiator for that item. So here we have a user array with each item being a unique piece of information about the user,

// const user = ['Tyler McGinnis', '@tylermcginnis', 'Eden, Utah'];
// You‚Äôll notice that this array probably should just be an object. But sometimes you have to take what you can get from weird external API‚Äôs. Typically if we want to better identify each item in the array we need to create a variable for each item.

// const name = user[0];
// const handle = user[1];
// const location = user[2];
// However just like with objects, array destructuring allows us to more effectively extract items from an array so the above code, can now look like the code below.

// const [ name, handle, location ] = user;
// Just as we saw from objects you can use array destructuring with function invocations. For example, below ‚Äúsplit‚Äù is going to return an array with each item in the array being a specific property of the car.

// const cvs = '1997,Ford,F350,MustSell!'
// const [ year, make, model, description ] = csv.split(',');
// By using array destructuring, we are able to extract each property into their own, user readable variable.

// So that‚Äôs it in regards to the basics of destructuring, again destructuring allows us to easily extract data from an object or an array. There are, however, what I‚Äôd consider to be more advanced features of destructuring that are worth taking a look at.

// For example, what if when we do destructure an object, we wanted the variable name to be different than the property name on that object. So say we had an object that looked like this,

// const user = {
//   n: 'Tyler McGinnis',
//   h: '@tylermcginnis',
//   l: 'Eden, Utah'
// };
// Since we are not masochists and we actually like the other developers on our team, we don‚Äôt want to make three one letter variable names. Instead, we can have the property names on the left of the colon and the new variable names on the right. Now, we are not only destructuring the user object, but we are also renaming the poorly named properties into more easily understood variable names.

// const { n: name, h: handle, l: location } = user;
// console.log(name) // Tyler McGinnis
// console.log(handle) // @tylermcginnis
// console.log(location) // Eden, Utah
// This may seem like a rarely used feature, but it is actually pretty common. To find a real world example we don‚Äôt have to look very far. This is the implementation of the render method in React Router Native‚Äôs Link component. Note how we‚Äôre renaming component with a lowercase ‚Äúc‚Äù to Component with a capitalized ‚Äúc‚Äù.

// render () {
//   const { component: Component, to , replace, ...rest } = this.props
//   return <Component {...rest} onPress={this.handlePress}/>
// }
// Next, let‚Äôs talk about function arguments and parameters. Below we have a fetchRepos() function which is going to be in charge of fetching a group of repositories from the Github API.

// function fetchRepos (language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter) {

// }
// The first thing you‚Äôll notice is that we have a lot of control over the type of repositories that we will be fetching. Fortunately, this leads to a stupid amount of arguments that can be passed into the function. Currently when we invoke our fetchRepos() function, we have two issues. First, we need to remember or look up which arguments go in which order. Second, we need to read and hope that the documentation has instructions for what to do with our arguments that we do not care about. In this case, we will just use null and hope for the best.

// function fetchRepos (language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter) {

// }

// fetchRepos('JavaScript', 100, null, new Date('01.01.2017').getTime(),null);
// The good news is that destructuring helps us with both of these problems. First, let‚Äôs solve the positional parameters problem. What if instead of passing in each argument one by one, we pass in an object instead? Now, before we ever need to look at the function definition of fetchRepos, we know exactly what information it needs. Even more important, order no longer matters.

// function fetchRepos (language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter) {

// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   maxStars: null,
//   createdAfter: null,
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// Now we need to modify the fetchRepos function definition. This is where destructuring comes into play. Because we are receiving an object as the argument to the function, we can destructure it. So now the code above, can be changed to this.

// function fetchRepos ({ language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter }) {

// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   maxStars: null,
//   createdAfter: null,
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// Again, the biggest benefit here is that we have removed the order out of the equation entirely, so that‚Äôs one less thing we have to worry about.

// The second problem we had earlier with our code was that we needed to figure out what to do with the arguments we did not care about. Before we just passed in null, but now that we are passing in an object rather than arguments one by one, we can actually just remove the null values altogether and that will give us a function invocation that looks like this.

// function fetchRepos ({ language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter }) {

// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// This now leads us back to our function definition of fetchRepos. We need a way to establish default values for any properties that aren‚Äôt on the arguments object when the function is invoked. Typically that would look like this.

// function fetchRepos ({ language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter }) {
//   language = language || All;
//   minStars = minStars || 0;
//   maxStars = maxStars || '';
//   createdBefore = createdBefore || '';
//   createdAfter = createdAfter || '';
// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// For each different possible property, we‚Äôd set the value of that property to itself or a default value if the original value was undefined. Luckily for us, another feature of destructuring is it allows you to set default values for any properties. If a partially destructured value is undefined, it will default to whatever you specify. What that means is that the ugly code above can be transformed into this,

// function fetchRepos({ language='All', minStars=0, maxStars='', createdBefore='', createdAfter='' }){

// }
// We set the default value of each property in the same place where we just destructured the parameters. Now that we‚Äôve seen the power of using object destructuring to destructure an object‚Äôs parameters, can the same thing be done with array destructuring? Turns out, it can.

// My favorite example of this is with Promise.all. Below we have a getUserData function.

// function getUserData (player) {
//   return Promise.all([
//     getProfile(player),
//     getRepos(player)
//   ]).then(function (data) {
//     const profile = data[0];
//     const repos = data[1];

//     return {
//       profile: profile,
//       repos: repos
//     }
//   })
// }
// Notice it‚Äôs taking in a player and returning us the invocation of calling Promise.all. Both getProfile and getRepos return a promise. The whole point of this getUserDate function is that it‚Äôs going to take in a player and return an object with that player's profile as well as that player's repositories. If you‚Äôre not familiar with the Promise.all API, what‚Äôs going to happen here is getProfile and getRepos are both asynchronous functions. When those promises resolve (or when we get that information back from the Github API), the function that we passed to then is going to be invoked receiving an array (in this case we are calling it data). The first element in that array is going to be the user‚Äôs profile and the second item in the array is going to be the user‚Äôs repositories. You‚Äôll notice that order matters here. For example, if we were to pass another invocation to Promise.all, say getUsersFollowers, then the third item in our data array would be their followers.

// The first update we can make to this code is we can destructure our data array. Now we still have our profile and repos variables, but instead of plucking out the items one by one, we destructure them.

// function getUserData (player) {
//   return Promise.all([
//     getProfile(player),
//     getRepos(player)
//   ]).then(function (data) {
//     const [ profile, repos ] = data
//     return {
//       profile: profile,
//       repos: repos
//     }
//   })
// }
// Now just as we saw with objects, we can move that destructuring into the parameter itself.

// function getUserData (player) {
//   return Promise.all([
//     getProfile(player),
//     getRepos(player)
//   ]).then(([ profile, repos ]) => {
//     return {
//       profile: profile,
//       repos: repos
//     }
//   })
// }
// Now we still have profile and repos, but those are being created with array destructuring inside of the function‚Äôs parameters.
}


function ShorthandProperties(){
    
// With Shorthand Properties, whenever you have a variable which is the same name as a property on an object, when constructing the object, you can omit the property name.

// What that means is that code that used to look like this,

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name: name,
//     id: id,
//     avatar: avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now()
//   }
// }
// can now look like this.

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name,
//     id,
//     avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now()
//   }
// }
// Shorthand Method Names
// Now, what if one of those properties was a function?

// A function that is a property on an object is called a method. With ES6‚Äôs Shorthand Method Names, you can omit the function keyword completely. What that means is that code that used to look like this,

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name,
//     id,
//     avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now(),
//     save: function () {
//       // save message
//     }
//   }
// }
// can now look like this

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name,
//     id,
//     avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now(),
//     save () {
//       //save message
//     }
//   }
// }
}

function computedPropertyNames(){
//     ES6‚Äôs ‚ÄúComputed Property Names‚Äù feature allows you to have an expression (a piece of code that results in a single value like a variable or function invocation) be computed as a property name on an object.

// For example, say you wanted to create a function that took in two arguments (key, value) and returned an object using those arguments. Before Computed Property Names, because the property name on the object was a variable (key), you‚Äôd have to create the object first, then use bracket notation to assign that property to the value.

// function objectify (key, value) {
//   let obj = {}
//   obj[key] = value
//   return obj
// }

// objectify('name', 'Tyler') // { name: 'Tyler' }
// However, now with Computed Property Names, you can use object literal notation to assign the expression as a property on the object without having to create it first. So the code above can now be rewritten like this.

// function objectify (key, value) {
//   return {
//     [key]: value
//   }
// }

// objectify('name', 'Tyler') // { name: 'Tyler' }
// Where key can be any expression as long as it‚Äôs wrapped in brackets, [].

}
