/////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Variable Declaration vs Initialization ////
///////////////////////////////////////////////
// A variable declaration introduces a new identifier.

// var declaration
// Above we create a new identifier called declaration. In JavaScript, variables are initialized with the value of undefined when they are created. What that means is if we try to log the declaration variable, we‚Äôll get undefined.

// var declaration

// console.log(declaration) // undefined
// So if we log the declaration variable, we get undefined.

// In contrast to variable declaration, variable initialization is when you first assign a value to a variable.

// var declaration

// console.log(declaration) // undefined

// declaration = 'This is an initialization'
// So here we‚Äôre initializing the declaration variable by assigning it to a string.

// This leads us to our second concept, Scope.

// Scope
// Scope defines where variables and functions are accessible inside of your program. In JavaScript, there are two kinds of scope - global scope, and function scope. According to the official spec,

// ‚ÄúIf the variable statement occurs inside a FunctionDeclaration, the variables are defined with function-local scope in that function.‚Äù.

// What that means is if you create a variable with var, that variable is ‚Äúscoped‚Äù to the function it was created in and is only accessible inside of that function or, any nested functions.

// function getDate () {
//   var date = new Date()

//   return date
// }

// getDate()
// console.log(date) // ‚ùå Reference Error
// Above we try to access a variable outside of the function it was declared. Because date is ‚Äúscoped‚Äù to the getData function, it‚Äôs only accessible inside of getDate itself or any nested functions inside of getDate (as seen below).

// function getDate () {
//   var date = new Date()

//   function formatDate () {
//     return date.toDateString().slice(4) // ‚úÖ
//   }

//   return formatDate()
// }

// getDate()
// console.log(date) // ‚ùå Reference Error
// Now let‚Äôs look at a more advanced example. Say we had an array of prices and we needed a function that took in that array as well as a discount and returned us a new array of discounted prices. The end goal might look something like this.

// discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) // [50, 100, 150]
// And the implementation might look something like this

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   return discounted
// }
// Seems simple enough but what does this have to do with block scope? Take a look at that for loop. Are the variables declared inside of it accessible outside of it? Turns out, they are.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// If JavaScript is the only programming language you know, you may not think anything of this. However, if you‚Äôre coming to JavaScript from another programming language, specifically a programming language that is blocked scope, you‚Äôre probably a little bit concerned about what‚Äôs going on here. It‚Äôs not really broken, it‚Äôs just kind of weird. There‚Äôs not really a reason to still have access to i, discountedPrice, and finalPrice outside of the for loop. It doesn‚Äôt really do us any good and it may even cause us harm in some cases. However, since variables declared with var are function scoped, you do.

// Now that we‚Äôve discussed variable declarations, initializations, and scope, the last thing we need to flush out before we dive into let and const is hoisting.

// Hoisting
// Remember earlier we said that ‚ÄúIn JavaScript, variables are initialized with the value of undefined when they are created.‚Äù. Turns out, that‚Äôs all that ‚ÄúHoisting‚Äù is. The JavaScript interpreter will assign variable declarations a default value of undefined during what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúCreation‚Äù phase.

// For a much more in depth guide on the Creation Phase, Hoisting, and Scopes see ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Guide to Hoisting, Scopes, and Closures in JavaScript‚Äù

// Let‚Äôs take a look at the previous example and see how hoisting affects it.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = undefined
//   var i = undefined
//   var discountedPrice = undefined
//   var finalPrice = undefined

//   discounted = []
//   for (i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// Notice all the variable declarations were assigned a default value of undefined. That‚Äôs why if you try access one of those variables before it was actually declared, you‚Äôll just get undefined.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   console.log(discounted) // undefined

//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// Now that you know everything there is to know about var, let‚Äôs finally talk about the whole point of why you‚Äôre here, what‚Äôs the difference between var, let, and const?

// var VS let VS const
// First, let‚Äôs compare var and let. The main difference between var and let is that instead of being function scoped, let is block scoped. What that means is that a variable created with the let keyword is available inside the ‚Äúblock‚Äù that it was created in as well as any nested blocks. When I say ‚Äúblock‚Äù, I mean anything surrounded by a curly brace {} like in a for loop or an if statement.

// So let‚Äôs look back to our discountPrices function one last time.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// Remember that we were able to log i, discountedPrice, and finalPrice outside of the for loop since they were declared with var and var is function scoped. But now, what happens if we change those var declarations to use let and try to run it?

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   let discounted = []

//   for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i)
//   console.log(discountedPrice)
//   console.log(finalPrice)

//   return discounted
// }

// discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) // ‚ùå ReferenceError: i is not defined
// üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We get ReferenceError: i is not defined. What this tells us is that variables declared with let are block scoped, not function scoped. So trying to access i (or discountedPrice or finalPrice) outside of the ‚Äúblock‚Äù they were declared in is going to give us a reference error as we just barely saw.

// var VS let

// var: function scoped

// let: block scoped
// The next difference has to do with Hoisting. Earlier we said that the definition of hoisting was ‚ÄúThe JavaScript interpreter will assign variable declarations a default value of undefined during what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄòCreation‚Äô phase.‚Äù We even saw this in action by logging a variable before it was declared (you get undefined)

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   console.log(discounted) // undefined

//   var discounted = []

//   for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// I can‚Äôt think of any use case where you‚Äôd actually want to access a variable before it was declared. It seems like throwing a ReferenceError would be a better default than returning undefined. In fact, this is exactly what let does. If you try to access a variable declared with let before it‚Äôs declared, instead of getting undefined (like with those variables declared with var), you‚Äôll get a ReferenceError.

// function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
//   console.log(discounted) // ‚ùå ReferenceError

//   let discounted = []

//   for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
//     let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
//     let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
//     discounted.push(finalPrice)
//   }

//   console.log(i) // 3
//   console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
//   console.log(finalPrice) // 150

//   return discounted
// }
// var VS let

// var:
//   function scoped
//   undefined when accessing a variable before it's declared

// let:
//   block scoped
//   ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared
// let VS const
// Now that you understand the difference between var and let, what about const? Turns out, const is almost exactly the same as let. However, the only difference is that once you‚Äôve assigned a value to a variable using const, you can‚Äôt reassign it to a new value.

// let name = 'Tyler'
// const handle = 'tylermcginnis'

// name = 'Tyler McGinnis' // ‚úÖ
// handle = '@tylermcginnis' // ‚ùå TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
// The take away above is that variables declared with let can be re-assigned, but variables declared with const can‚Äôt be.

// Cool, so anytime you want a variable to be immutable, you can declare it with const. Well, not quite. Just because a variable is declared with const doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs immutable, all it means is the value can‚Äôt be re-assigned. Here‚Äôs a good example.

// const person = {
//   name: 'Kim Kardashian'
// }

// person.name = 'Kim Kardashian West' // ‚úÖ

// person = {} // ‚ùå Assignment to constant variable.
// Notice that changing a property on an object isn‚Äôt reassigning it, so even though an object is declared with const, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt mutate any of its properties. It only means you can‚Äôt reassign it to a new value.

// Now the most important question we haven‚Äôt answered yet, should you use var, let, or const? The most popular opinion, and the opinion that I subscribe to, is that you should always use const unless you know the variable is going to change. The reason for this is by using const, you‚Äôre signalling to your future self as well as any other future developers that have to read your code that this variable shouldn‚Äôt change. If it will need to change (like in a for loop), you should use let.

// So between variables that change and variables that don‚Äôt change, there‚Äôs not much left. That means you shouldn‚Äôt ever have to use var again.

// Now the unpopular opinion, though it still has some validity to it, is that you should never use const because even though you‚Äôre trying to signal that the variable is immutable, as we saw above, that‚Äôs not entirely the case. Developers who subscribe to this opinion always use let unless they have variables that are actually constants like _LOCATION_ = ....

// So to recap, var is function scoped and if you try to use a variable declared with var before the actual declaration, you‚Äôll just get undefined. const and let are blocked scoped and if you try to use variable declared with let or const before the declaration you‚Äôll get a ReferenceError. Finally the difference between let and const is that once you‚Äôve assigned a value to const, you can‚Äôt reassign it, but with let, you can.

// var VS let VS const

// var:
//   function scoped
//   undefined when accessing a variable before it's declared

// let:
//   block scoped
//   ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared

// const:
//   block scoped
//   ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared
//   can't be reassigned

}

function ObjectandArrayDestructuring(){
//     In this post, we‚Äôll cover an ES2015 feature called destructuring. To better understand it, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the basics of Javascript objects. To add a single property to an object, you use dot notation. With dot notation, you can only add properties to an object one at a time. The same syntax can be used to extract data, again, one property at a time.

// const user = {};
// user.name = 'Tyler McGinnis';
// user.handle = '@tylermcginnis';
// user.location = 'Eden, Utah';

// const name = user.name;
// const handle = user.handle;
// If you wanted to add multiple properties to an object at the same time, you would need to use JavaScript‚Äôs ‚Äúobject literal notation‚Äù when you initialize the object.

// const user = {
//   name: 'Tyler McGinnis';
//   handle: '@tylermcginnis';
//   location: 'Eden, Utah';
// };

// const name = user.name;
// const handle = user.handle;
// There‚Äôs a way to add properties one at a time, extract properties one at a time, add multiple properties at the same time, but unfortunately, there‚Äôs no comparable way to extract multiple properties from an object at the same time. That is, until ‚Äúdestructuring‚Äù was introduced in ES2015. Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties from an object. This can drastically decrease the amount of code we need to write when we want to extract data from an object, because what used to look like this,

// const name = user.name;
// const handle = user.handle;
// const location = user.location;
// can now look like this,

// const { name, handle, location } = user;
// The syntax can be a little bit weird but know that these two blocks of code are identical in that they both create and initialize three new variables. You can think of it like this, if you want to add properties to an object, do it as you are used to, on the right-hand side of the equal sign. If you want to extract properties from an object, do it on the left-hand side of the equal sign.

// Destructuring also allows you to destructure the results of function invocations. For example, below we have a function called getUser() which returns the user object. Rather than invoking getUser() and grabbing all of the properties off of it one by one, we could get the same result by destructuring the result of that invocation.

// function getUser () {
//   return {
//     name: 'Tyler McGinnis',
//     handle: '@tylermcginnis',
//     location: 'Eden, Utah'
//   };
// }

// const { name, handle, location } = getUser();
// Up until this point we‚Äôve talked about how destructuring helps us extract data from objects, but what about arrays? Though not as common as object destructuring, array destructuring is a thing and it is still pretty useful in certain circumstances, specifically when the location of an item in the array is the main differentiator for that item. So here we have a user array with each item being a unique piece of information about the user,

// const user = ['Tyler McGinnis', '@tylermcginnis', 'Eden, Utah'];
// You‚Äôll notice that this array probably should just be an object. But sometimes you have to take what you can get from weird external API‚Äôs. Typically if we want to better identify each item in the array we need to create a variable for each item.

// const name = user[0];
// const handle = user[1];
// const location = user[2];
// However just like with objects, array destructuring allows us to more effectively extract items from an array so the above code, can now look like the code below.

// const [ name, handle, location ] = user;
// Just as we saw from objects you can use array destructuring with function invocations. For example, below ‚Äúsplit‚Äù is going to return an array with each item in the array being a specific property of the car.

// const cvs = '1997,Ford,F350,MustSell!'
// const [ year, make, model, description ] = csv.split(',');
// By using array destructuring, we are able to extract each property into their own, user readable variable.

// So that‚Äôs it in regards to the basics of destructuring, again destructuring allows us to easily extract data from an object or an array. There are, however, what I‚Äôd consider to be more advanced features of destructuring that are worth taking a look at.

// For example, what if when we do destructure an object, we wanted the variable name to be different than the property name on that object. So say we had an object that looked like this,

// const user = {
//   n: 'Tyler McGinnis',
//   h: '@tylermcginnis',
//   l: 'Eden, Utah'
// };
// Since we are not masochists and we actually like the other developers on our team, we don‚Äôt want to make three one letter variable names. Instead, we can have the property names on the left of the colon and the new variable names on the right. Now, we are not only destructuring the user object, but we are also renaming the poorly named properties into more easily understood variable names.

// const { n: name, h: handle, l: location } = user;
// console.log(name) // Tyler McGinnis
// console.log(handle) // @tylermcginnis
// console.log(location) // Eden, Utah
// This may seem like a rarely used feature, but it is actually pretty common. To find a real world example we don‚Äôt have to look very far. This is the implementation of the render method in React Router Native‚Äôs Link component. Note how we‚Äôre renaming component with a lowercase ‚Äúc‚Äù to Component with a capitalized ‚Äúc‚Äù.

// render () {
//   const { component: Component, to , replace, ...rest } = this.props
//   return <Component {...rest} onPress={this.handlePress}/>
// }
// Next, let‚Äôs talk about function arguments and parameters. Below we have a fetchRepos() function which is going to be in charge of fetching a group of repositories from the Github API.

// function fetchRepos (language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter) {

// }
// The first thing you‚Äôll notice is that we have a lot of control over the type of repositories that we will be fetching. Fortunately, this leads to a stupid amount of arguments that can be passed into the function. Currently when we invoke our fetchRepos() function, we have two issues. First, we need to remember or look up which arguments go in which order. Second, we need to read and hope that the documentation has instructions for what to do with our arguments that we do not care about. In this case, we will just use null and hope for the best.

// function fetchRepos (language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter) {

// }

// fetchRepos('JavaScript', 100, null, new Date('01.01.2017').getTime(),null);
// The good news is that destructuring helps us with both of these problems. First, let‚Äôs solve the positional parameters problem. What if instead of passing in each argument one by one, we pass in an object instead? Now, before we ever need to look at the function definition of fetchRepos, we know exactly what information it needs. Even more important, order no longer matters.

// function fetchRepos (language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter) {

// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   maxStars: null,
//   createdAfter: null,
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// Now we need to modify the fetchRepos function definition. This is where destructuring comes into play. Because we are receiving an object as the argument to the function, we can destructure it. So now the code above, can be changed to this.

// function fetchRepos ({ language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter }) {

// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   maxStars: null,
//   createdAfter: null,
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// Again, the biggest benefit here is that we have removed the order out of the equation entirely, so that‚Äôs one less thing we have to worry about.

// The second problem we had earlier with our code was that we needed to figure out what to do with the arguments we did not care about. Before we just passed in null, but now that we are passing in an object rather than arguments one by one, we can actually just remove the null values altogether and that will give us a function invocation that looks like this.

// function fetchRepos ({ language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter }) {

// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// This now leads us back to our function definition of fetchRepos. We need a way to establish default values for any properties that aren‚Äôt on the arguments object when the function is invoked. Typically that would look like this.

// function fetchRepos ({ language, minStars, maxStars, createdBefore, createAfter }) {
//   language = language || All;
//   minStars = minStars || 0;
//   maxStars = maxStars || '';
//   createdBefore = createdBefore || '';
//   createdAfter = createdAfter || '';
// }

// fetchRepos({
//   language: 'JavaScript',
//   createdBefore: new Date('01/01/2017').getTime(),
//   minStars: 100,
// });
// For each different possible property, we‚Äôd set the value of that property to itself or a default value if the original value was undefined. Luckily for us, another feature of destructuring is it allows you to set default values for any properties. If a partially destructured value is undefined, it will default to whatever you specify. What that means is that the ugly code above can be transformed into this,

// function fetchRepos({ language='All', minStars=0, maxStars='', createdBefore='', createdAfter='' }){

// }
// We set the default value of each property in the same place where we just destructured the parameters. Now that we‚Äôve seen the power of using object destructuring to destructure an object‚Äôs parameters, can the same thing be done with array destructuring? Turns out, it can.

// My favorite example of this is with Promise.all. Below we have a getUserData function.

// function getUserData (player) {
//   return Promise.all([
//     getProfile(player),
//     getRepos(player)
//   ]).then(function (data) {
//     const profile = data[0];
//     const repos = data[1];

//     return {
//       profile: profile,
//       repos: repos
//     }
//   })
// }
// Notice it‚Äôs taking in a player and returning us the invocation of calling Promise.all. Both getProfile and getRepos return a promise. The whole point of this getUserDate function is that it‚Äôs going to take in a player and return an object with that player's profile as well as that player's repositories. If you‚Äôre not familiar with the Promise.all API, what‚Äôs going to happen here is getProfile and getRepos are both asynchronous functions. When those promises resolve (or when we get that information back from the Github API), the function that we passed to then is going to be invoked receiving an array (in this case we are calling it data). The first element in that array is going to be the user‚Äôs profile and the second item in the array is going to be the user‚Äôs repositories. You‚Äôll notice that order matters here. For example, if we were to pass another invocation to Promise.all, say getUsersFollowers, then the third item in our data array would be their followers.

// The first update we can make to this code is we can destructure our data array. Now we still have our profile and repos variables, but instead of plucking out the items one by one, we destructure them.

// function getUserData (player) {
//   return Promise.all([
//     getProfile(player),
//     getRepos(player)
//   ]).then(function (data) {
//     const [ profile, repos ] = data
//     return {
//       profile: profile,
//       repos: repos
//     }
//   })
// }
// Now just as we saw with objects, we can move that destructuring into the parameter itself.

// function getUserData (player) {
//   return Promise.all([
//     getProfile(player),
//     getRepos(player)
//   ]).then(([ profile, repos ]) => {
//     return {
//       profile: profile,
//       repos: repos
//     }
//   })
// }
// Now we still have profile and repos, but those are being created with array destructuring inside of the function‚Äôs parameters.
}


function ShorthandProperties(){
    
// With Shorthand Properties, whenever you have a variable which is the same name as a property on an object, when constructing the object, you can omit the property name.

// What that means is that code that used to look like this,

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name: name,
//     id: id,
//     avatar: avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now()
//   }
// }
// can now look like this.

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name,
//     id,
//     avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now()
//   }
// }
// Shorthand Method Names
// Now, what if one of those properties was a function?

// A function that is a property on an object is called a method. With ES6‚Äôs Shorthand Method Names, you can omit the function keyword completely. What that means is that code that used to look like this,

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name,
//     id,
//     avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now(),
//     save: function () {
//       // save message
//     }
//   }
// }
// can now look like this

// function formatMessage (name, id, avatar) {
//   return {
//     name,
//     id,
//     avatar,
//     timestamp: Date.now(),
//     save () {
//       //save message
//     }
//   }
// }
}

function computedPropertyNames(){
//     ES6‚Äôs ‚ÄúComputed Property Names‚Äù feature allows you to have an expression (a piece of code that results in a single value like a variable or function invocation) be computed as a property name on an object.

// For example, say you wanted to create a function that took in two arguments (key, value) and returned an object using those arguments. Before Computed Property Names, because the property name on the object was a variable (key), you‚Äôd have to create the object first, then use bracket notation to assign that property to the value.

// function objectify (key, value) {
//   let obj = {}
//   obj[key] = value
//   return obj
// }

// objectify('name', 'Tyler') // { name: 'Tyler' }
// However, now with Computed Property Names, you can use object literal notation to assign the expression as a property on the object without having to create it first. So the code above can now be rewritten like this.

// function objectify (key, value) {
//   return {
//     [key]: value
//   }
// }

// objectify('name', 'Tyler') // { name: 'Tyler' }
// Where key can be any expression as long as it‚Äôs wrapped in brackets, [].

  return 'Hello, ' + name +
    '. We\'ve emailed you at ' + email +
    '. Your user id is "' + id + '".'
}
All we‚Äôre trying to do is take three variables (name, email, and id) and create a sentence using them. Sadly, in order to do that, it‚Äôs a balancing act between using the right quotations, + signs, and escaping (\) the right characters. This is the exact problem that Template Literals (also called Template Strings) was created to solve.

With Template Literals, instead of using single ('') or double quotes (""), you use backticks (``) (located to the left of the 1 key if you‚Äôre using a QWERTY keyboard üôÇ). Anywhere inside of your backticks where you have an expression (a piece of code that results in a single value like a variable or function invocation), you can wrap that expression in ${expression goes here}.

So using Template Literals, we can take the confusing makeGreeting function above and simplify it to look like this.

function makeGreeting (name, email, id) {
  return `Hello, ${name}. We've emailed you at ${email}. Your user id is "${id}".`
}
Much better. No more worrying about using the right quotations, + signs, and escaping the right characters. Not only is it easier to write, but it‚Äôs also much easier to read.

Now instead of having a makeGreeting function, say we wanted a makeGreetingTemplate function that returned us an HTML string that we could throw into the DOM. Without template strings, we‚Äôd have something like this.

function makeGreetingTemplate (name, email, id) {
  return '<div>' +
    '<h1>Hello, ' + name + '.</h1>' +
    '<p>We\'ve emailed you at ' + email + '. ' +
    'Your user id is "' + id + '".</p>' +
  '</div>'
}
Perfect, except for the fact that not only is it terribly hard to write, it‚Äôs even harder to read. What‚Äôs nice about ES6‚Äôs Template Strings is they also support multi-line strings. That means, using Template Strings, we can rewrite makeGreetingTemplate to look like this.

function makeGreetingTemplate (name, email, id) {
  return `
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, ${name}</h1>
      <p>
        We've email you at ${email}.
        Your user id is "${id}".
      </p>
    </div>
  `
}
    */ 
}


function ArrowFunctions(){
/*
Arrow functions provide two main benefits over regular functions. First, they‚Äôre more terse. Second, they make managing the this keyword a little easier.

What I‚Äôve seen with new developers learning about Arrow Functions is that it‚Äôs not really the concept itself that‚Äôs difficult to grasp. Odds are you‚Äôre already familiar with functions, their benefits, use cases, etc. However, for some reason, it‚Äôs the actual syntax that throws your brain for a loop when you‚Äôre first exposed to them. Because of that, we‚Äôre going to take things slow and first just introduce how the syntax compares with typical functions you‚Äôre used to.

Here we have a very basic function declaration and a function expression.

// fn declaration
function add (x,y) {
  return x + y;
}

// fn expression
var add = function (x,y) {
  return x + y;
}
Now, if we wanted to change that function expression to an arrow function, we‚Äôd do it like this.

var add = function (x,y) {
  return x + y;
}

var add = (x,y) => {
  return x + y;
}
Again, the most difficult part about getting started with arrow functions is just getting used to the syntax. Once you‚Äôre cool with it, move on and we‚Äôll dive deeper.

At this point you may be wondering what all the hype is about with arrow functions. Truthfully, the example above doesn‚Äôt really lend well to their strengths. What I‚Äôve found is that arrow functions really thrive when you‚Äôre using anonymous functions. We can warm our brain up a little more to the syntax by looking at another basic example of this is using .map.

users.map(function () {

})

users.map(() => {

})
Alright enough with the warm up. Let‚Äôs dive into it.

Let‚Äôs say we had a getTweets function that took in a user id and, after hitting a poorly designed API, returned us all of the user‚Äôs Tweets with over 50 stars and retweets. Using promise chaining, that function may look something like this,

function getTweets (uid) {
  return fetch('https://api.users.com/' + uid)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json()
    })
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.data
    }).then(function (tweets) {
      return tweets.filter(function (tweet) {
        return tweet.stars > 50
      })
    }).then(function (tweets) {
      return tweets.filter(function (tweet) {
        return tweet.rts > 50
      })
    })
}
Well, it works. But it‚Äôs not the prettiest function in the world ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Even though this specific implementation is kind of dense, the idea is all too common. Let‚Äôs take a look at how what we know about arrow functions thus far, can improve our getTweets function.

function getTweets (uid) {
  return fetch('https://api.users.com/' + uid)
    .then((response) => {
      return response.json()
    })
    .then((response) => {
      return response.data
    }).then((tweets) => {
      return tweets.filter((tweet) => {
        return tweet.stars > 50
      })
    }).then((tweets) => {
      return tweets.filter((tweet) => {
        return tweet.rts > 50
      })
    })
}
OK, cool. It looks basically the same we just didn‚Äôt have to type function. Beneficial, but nothing worth Tweeting about. Let‚Äôs look at the next benefit of arrow functions, ‚Äúimplicit returns‚Äù.

With arrow functions, if your function has a ‚Äúconcise body‚Äù (a fancy way for saying one line function), then you can omit the ‚Äúreturn‚Äù keyword and the value will be returned automatically (or implicitly).

So the add example from earlier can be updated to look like this,

var add = function (x,y) {
  return x + y;
}

var add = (x,y) => x + y;
and more importantly, the getTweets example can be update to look like this,

function getTweets (uid) {
  return fetch('https://api.users.com/' + uid)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((response) => response.data)
    .then((tweets) => tweets.filter((tweet) => tweet.stars > 50))
    .then((tweets) => tweets.filter((tweet) => tweet.rts > 50))
}
Now we‚Äôre talking üìà. That code is not only much easier to write, but more importantly, it‚Äôs much easier to read.

Now, one further change we can make is that if the arrow function only has one parameter, you can omit the () around it. With that in mind, getTweets now looks like this,

function getTweets (uid) {
  return fetch('https://api.users.com/' + uid)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(response => response.data)
    .then(tweets => tweets.filter(tweet => tweet.stars > 50))
    .then(tweets => tweets.filter(tweet => tweet.rts > 50))
}
Overall, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a huge improvement in just about every category.

The next benefit of arrow functions is how they manage the this keyword. If you‚Äôre not familiar with the this keyword, check out this post - Understanding the this keyword, call, apply, and bind in JavaScript.

Let‚Äôs take a look at some typical React code.

class Popular extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    this.state = {
      repos: null,
    };

    this.updateLanguage = this.updateLanguage.bind(this);
  }
  componentDidMount () {
    this.updateLanguage('javascript')
  }
  updateLanguage(lang) {
    api.fetchPopularRepos(lang)
      .then(function (repos) {
        this.setState(function () {
          return {
            repos: repos
          }
        });
      });
  }
  render() {
    // Stuff
  }
}
When the component mounts, it‚Äôs making an API request (to the Github API) to fetch JavaScript‚Äôs most popular repositories. When it gets the repositories, it takes them and updates the component‚Äôs local state, or at least that‚Äôs what we want it to do. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt do that. Instead, we get an error. Can you spot the bug?

The error the code above is going to throw is ‚Äúcannot read setState of undefined‚Äù. Now, why that‚Äôs happening is outside the scope of this post (again, read or watch Understanding the this keyword, call, apply, and bind in JavaScript if you need it) but a typical ES5 solution uses .bind and looks something like this

class Popular extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    this.state = {
      repos: null,
    };

    this.updateLanguage = this.updateLanguage.bind(this);
  }
  componentDidMount () {
    this.updateLanguage('javascript')
  }
  updateLanguage(lang) {
    api.fetchPopularRepos(lang)
      .then(function (repos) {
        this.setState(function () {
          return {
            repos: repos
          }
        });
      }.bind(this));
  }
  render() {
    // Stuff
  }
}
This is the second major benefit as to why arrow functions are great, they don‚Äôt create their own context. What that means is that typically the this keyword Just Works‚Ñ¢ without you having to worry about what context a specific function is going to be invoked in. So by using arrow functions in the updateLanguage method, we don‚Äôt have to worry about this which means we don‚Äôt have to call .bind anymore.

updateLanguage(lang) {
  api.fetchPopularRepos(lang)
    .then((repos) => {
      this.setState(() => {
        return {
          repos: repos
        }
      });
    });
}

Nice to knows
At this point, we‚Äôve covered all of the ‚Äúneed to knows‚Äù about arrow functions. There are, however, two different ‚Äúnice to knows‚Äù that I think are worth mentioning.

Looking at the updateLanguage method again, if we wanted to implicitly return the object inside of the setState callback, how would we do that? Your first intuition would be to remove the return statement and just return an object.

api.fetchPopularRepos(lang)
  .then((repos) => {
    this.setState(() => {
      repos: repos
    });
  });
The problem with this, as you probably guessed, is that that syntax is the exact same as creating a function body. JavaScript can‚Äôt magically tell the difference between when you want to create a function body and when you want to return an object so it‚Äôll throw an error. To fix this, we can wrap the object inside of ().

api.fetchPopularRepos(lang)
  .then((repos) => {
    this.setState(() => ({
      repos: repos
    }));
  });
Now, with that syntax, we can use an arrow function to implicitly return an object.

Now I know if I don‚Äôt put this, someone will mention it. As a bonus since we‚Äôre using ES6, we can go ahead use ES6‚Äôs shorthand property and method names feature to get rid of the repos:repos and use Arrow Function‚Äôs implicit return to shorten it up a bit.

api.fetchPopularRepos(lang)
  .then((repos) =>
    this.setState(() => repos)
  );
Next tip. Say we wanted to examine the previous state of the component inside of setState by logging it. If this was your setState function, how would you approach logging nextState?

this.setState((nextState) => ({
  repos: repos
}));
The obvious move would be to change your implicit return to an explicit return, create a function body, then log inside of that body.

this.setState((nextState) => {
  console.log(nextState)
  return {
    repos: repos
  }
});
Well, that‚Äôs pretty annoying. There is a better way though and it‚Äôs done using the || operator. Instead of messing with all of your code, you can do something like this

this.setState((nextState) => console.log(nextState) || ({
  repos: repos
}));
*/

}

function DefaultParameters(){
/*Often times when writing a function, you need to assign default values for arguments that weren‚Äôt passed to the function when it was invoked.

For example, let‚Äôs say we were creating a calculatePayment function. This function has three parameters, price, salesTax, and discount. The purpose of this function, as the name implies, is to calculate the final price of a bill taking into account the initial price as well as any sales tax or discounts that should be applied.

With a function like this, the only parameter that we want to make required is the price. We‚Äôll set the default value of salesTax to 0.05 (5%) and the default value of discount to 0 so our function will still work if those values aren‚Äôt passed in when the function is invoked. This way, the consumer of this function can supply a sales tax as well as a discount if they want, but if they don‚Äôt, the default values will kick in.

calculatePayment(10) // 9.50
calculatePayment(10, 0, 10) // 9.00
Historically, one way you could accomplish this is by using the Logical || operator.

function calculatePayment (price, salesTax, discount) {
  salesTax = salesTax || 0.05
  discount = discount || 0

  // math
}
If you‚Äôre not familiar with ||, you can think of it like you would an if statement checking for falsy values.

function calculatePayment (price, salesTax, discount) {
  if (!salesTax) {
    salesTax = 0.05
  }

  if (!discount) {
    discount = 0
  }

  // math
}
However, this approach has some downsides. Can you spot the issue? What if we wanted to set the salesTax to 0? With our current implementation that would be impossible since 0 is classified as a falsy value so our if (!salesTax) would always evaluate to true setting the salesTax to our default value of 0.05. To fix this, let‚Äôs check for undefined rather than falsy.

function calculatePayment (price, salesTax, discount) {
  salesTax = typeof salesTax === 'undefined' ? 0.05 : salesTax
  discount = typeof discount === 'undefined' ? 0 : discount

  // math
}
Now, both salesTax and discount will only take on their default values if their arguments are undefined.

At this point our code works well, but as you‚Äôll see, there‚Äôs now a better way to do this with ES6‚Äôs ‚ÄúDefault Parameters‚Äù.

Default Parameters
Default Parameters allow you to set the default values for any parameters that are undefined when a function is invoked. Using Default Parameters, we can now update our calculatePayment function to look like this,

function calculatePayment (price, salesTax = 0.05, discount = 0) {

  // math
}
Now, just as we had before, if salesTax or discount are undefined when calculatePayment is invoked, they‚Äôll be set to their default values of 0.05 and 0.

Required Arguments
One neat trick you can do using Default Parameters is to throw an error if a function is invoked without a required argument. For example, what if we wanted calculatePayment to throw an error if the price wasn‚Äôt specified when it was invoked?

To do this, first create the function that will throw the error.

function isRequired (name) {
  throw new Error(`${name}` is required)
}
Next, using Default Parameters, assign the required parameter to the invocation of isRequired

function calculatePayment (
  price = isRequired('price'),
  salesTax = 0.05,
  discount = 0
) {

  // math
}
Now if calculatePayment is invoked without a price, JavaScript will invoke the isRequired function, throwing the error. Clever? Totally. A good idea? I‚Äôll leave that up to you. */
